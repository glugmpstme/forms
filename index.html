        		<div class="answer">The GLUG Install fest is your chance to get the powerful, free, and stable Linux operating system installed on your computer for no charge. Simply bring in your computer, and we will put Linux on it for you, or help you install it yourself. You do not have to give up your existing operating system to install Linux, i.e., if you already have Windows on your computer, you can have Linux installed, too, and then decide at boot time which one you want to use.</div>

        		<div class="answer">Here is a bit about us!

The MPSTME GNU/Linux User Group (GLUG) is a libre organisation which provides support and education for both the GNU/Linux novice and the aficionado. Primarily, the group meets in person, but support is also provided on-line through Facebook and Twitter.

GLUG is primarily focused on hobbyist users and professionals who are engaged in self- directed study.

The GLUG is not a committee, but a group of fervent enthusiasts willing to promote GNU/Linux and spread awareness about libre software among the students and faculty in the institute.

We function as a group and there is no hierarchical classification of members in the GLUG.

The GLUG aim to build a culture of self-motivated learning and professional software development on industry standard technologies.</div>
